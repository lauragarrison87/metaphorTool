Database of infographics

The following Excel sheet contains a database, in Sheet 'DATABASE', of 55 analyzed scientific infographics that adhered to our criteria. The collected information demonstrates our reasoning and contains general information about the infographics, URL to original sources, categorization of visual conceptual metaphors, interesting observations, placement of spatiotemporal data, and licensing information. For infographics that do not have embedded thumbnails, please use the original source URL.

Sheet two, named 'not_included', contains infographics 56- 103, which we initially collected but that did not adhere to our research criteria. Other than general information, they also contain a short description of why they were not included in the analysis in the column 'Reason for exclusion'.
