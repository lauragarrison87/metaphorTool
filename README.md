# CMT Exploratory Tool
This tool allows the exploration of deconstructed infographics and categorized visual and conceptual metaphors. 
Use buttons (Biomedicine, Climate, Space, Anthropology) to move between the four domains.
A spatiotemporal graph is placed on the left side and displays points that represent individual infographics (x axis= time, y axis= size). Some infographics (in biomedical, space, and anthropology domains) span across several spatial scales, which are represented by beveled rectangles.
Once a desired point (infographic) is clicked, general information will appear in the middle including the embedded infographic. On the right side, visual metaphor analysis will appear in the section. Due to copyright reasons, some infographics could not be embedded. Please follow the URL link provided (general information section) to reach the original source site. 

## Getting started 
1. Start a live server. We recommend Python Simple Server, which you can run with in your terminal `python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1` 


To open the tool, please open the exploratoryTool folder in your code editor. Once in the code editor, open index.html in any of the folders, e.g., ANTHRO, in live server.
